# Editor Protocol

The Editor Protocol is an open standard for building a rich text editor. Editors developed in accordance with the protocol allow you to make applications readable by humans and machines. The protocol structure features alternatives to cover all use-cases as there is no clear definition of what the standard should be. The choice is yours.

## Usage

[Plate](https://github.com/udecode/plate) is an example framework that will follow the Editor Protocol.

## Roadmap

_Weâ€™ll be publishing a public roadmap for the Editor Protocol soon._

<!-- See the [open issues](https://github.com/udecode/editor-protocol/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) for a list of some proposed features (and known issues). -->
